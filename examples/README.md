## R files for empirical applications

Two of these files are used to reproduce things that appear in the paper:
- DelaunayExampleforPaper.R: code for the figure with Delaunay triangulations,
- EXB_Lalonde.R: code for the NSW application.

Other files are reproducing applications that do not appear in the paper or illustrate some useful functions.
